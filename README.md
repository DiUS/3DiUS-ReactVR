# 3DiUS-ReactVR

Setup
---

```
npm install
```

Compile
---

```
npm run compile
```

Usage
---

Start the development server with this command:

```
npm start
```

After that goto the [http://localhost:8080](local) page.
Here you can upload a new background cubemap image which can then be viewed at the [http://localhost:8080/vr-scene](VR-Scene) endpoint.

This is using local storage for now, purely as a proof of concept, that is, the ability to update a VR scene on the fly via web. I am hoping this could be become a way to provide a simple first point toolset for prototyping UX early on in a VR project, without the need to bother devs or using Unity3D.
